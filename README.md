# HeyBuddyProject
This is a top down adventure game where the player walks around and collects Buddies tools that he left lying around.

#What I learned
- Using Dialogic in Godot
- Item collection
- Sound design
- Using an already animated player sprite

#Issues found
- Error with the dialogic set up, I will have to redo this. Current project is without the dialogic part within the gameplay
